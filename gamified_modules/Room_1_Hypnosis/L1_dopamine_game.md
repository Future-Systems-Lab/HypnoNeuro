## 🚀 Level 1 – Hypnosis Room: Flossing Routine & Dopamine Activation

**Neurotransmitter Focus:** Dopamine  
**Theme:** Using a gamified flossing ritual to rebuild motivation, self-trust, and micro-action consistency during mental wellness recovery.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To help users **reignite motivation and build momentum** by completing a flossing micro-action paired with calming breathwork and dopamine-reward visuals, transforming oral hygiene into a rewarding self-care ritual.

---

## 🧠 Rationale

- **Dopamine drives motivation and action initiation.**
- Depression and trauma can cause neglect of flossing and oral hygiene.
- Flossing serves as a *low-barrier micro-action* to activate dopamine pathways.
- Visualizing bacteria and debris removal builds satisfaction and motivation.
