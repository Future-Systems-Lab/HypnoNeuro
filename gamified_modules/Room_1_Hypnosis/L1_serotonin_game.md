## 🪥 Level 1 – Hypnosis Room: Brushing Teeth & Serotonin Activation

**Neurotransmitter Focus:** Serotonin  
**Theme:** Building structure, routine, and stability through a brushing teeth ritual paired with calming hypnosis to start or end the day.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To help users **break inertia during mental health crises by establishing a consistent, easy oral care ritual** that stabilizes serotonin pathways, reducing overwhelm and increasing a sense of accomplishment.

---

## 🧠 Rationale

- **Serotonin supports stability, routine, and emotional regulation.**
- Depression disrupts daily self-care habits like brushing teeth.
- Brushing teeth at consistent times paired with calming hypnosis builds structure, stabilizes serotonin, and provides a daily win.
- Consistency builds confidence and micro-motivation to expand into other self-care.
