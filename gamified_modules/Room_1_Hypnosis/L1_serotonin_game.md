## 🌀 Level 1 – Hypnosis Room: Serotonin & Brushing Teeth

**Neurotransmitter Focus:** Serotonin
**Theme:** Rebuilding stability and calm through daily oral care paired with mindfulness.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To help users re-establish **daily dental care routines often lost during mental health crises** while activating the serotonin system through structure, sensory cues, and calm reinforcement.

---

## 🧠 Rationale

* **Serotonin governs stability, calm, and daily rhythm.**
* Trauma and depression often disrupt routines, leading to oral neglect, infections, and inflammatory pathways that further destabilize mood.
* Brushing teeth daily reduces oral bacteria that release **lipopolysaccharides (LPS)**, which can increase systemic inflammation and lower serotonin synthesis.
* **FAERS data (2020–2024)** shows **SSRIs are the top drug class associated with suicide-related deaths and adverse events**, emphasizing the need for non-pharmaceutical serotonin support.

## ⚖️ Systemic Insight (FAERS Context)

> SSRIs, while widely prescribed for serotonin support, are associated with **high rates of suicide-related deaths and adverse events** according to the FDA FAERS database (2020–2024). This module offers a non-pharmaceutical pathway to stabilize serotonin safely through routine and micro-actions.
