## 🧘‍♀️ Level 1 – Hypnosis Room: GABA & Tongue Cleaning

**Neurotransmitter Focus:** GABA  
**Theme:** Inducing calm using tongue cleaning paired with breathwork to lower systemic inflammation and support GABA pathways.

---

🎯Objective

To support users in rebuilding daily rhythms often lost during mental health crises by introducing a safe, micro-action—tongue cleaning with breathwork—to reduce oral inflammation, activate the vagus nerve, and support natural GABA pathways. This helps reduce anxiety and overstimulation while empowering users with a non-pharmaceutical tool for nervous system regulation.

This module reframes tongue cleaning as mental hygiene, linking inflammation reduction and vagal activation to improved GABA signaling, providing users with a tangible, calming daily practice during recovery.



---

## 🧠 Rationale

- **GABA calms the nervous system, reducing overstimulation and anxiety.**
- Poor oral hygiene increases **LPS and inflammation**, lowering GABA activity.
- Trauma, stress, and anxiety often disrupt self-care, deepening GABA deficits.
- **FAERS data (2020–2024)** shows **benzodiazepines are the second most deadly psychiatric drug class**, highlighting the need for safe, non-pharmaceutical GABA support.

## ⚖️ Systemic Insight (FAERS Context)

> Benzodiazepines, widely used to target GABA pathways, show **high rates of dependency, overdose, and death** in FAERS data (2020–2024). This module offers a safe, daily alternative to support GABA naturally.

**“Calm can begin with a breath and a single small action.”**
