## 🧘‍♀️ Level 1 – Hypnosis Room: GABA & Tongue Cleaning

**Neurotransmitter Focus:** GABA  
**Theme:** Inducing calm using tongue cleaning paired with breathwork to lower systemic inflammation and support GABA pathways.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To help users establish a **low-barrier calming morning or evening ritual during mental health crises** using tongue cleaning and breath-paced mindfulness to naturally support GABA systems.

---

## 🧠 Rationale

- **GABA calms the nervous system, reducing overstimulation and anxiety.**
- Poor oral hygiene increases **LPS and inflammation**, lowering GABA activity.
- Trauma, stress, and anxiety often disrupt self-care, deepening GABA deficits.
- **FAERS data (2020–2024)** shows **benzodiazepines are the second most deadly psychiatric drug class**, highlighting the need for safe, non-pharmaceutical GABA support.

## ⚖️ Systemic Insight (FAERS Context)
