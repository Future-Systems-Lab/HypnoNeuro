## 🧠 Why a Laundry Game?

- **Executive-dysfunction friendly:** For many users, starting (or finishing) laundry is a stress trigger.  
- **Safe rehearsal space:** Simulating the task in-game lowers real-world overwhelm.  
- **Behavioral mirroring:** Repetition inside HypnoNeuro rewires initiation → completion loops that carry over to daily life.

## 🎮 Core Gameplay Flow

| Stage | In-Game Action | Purpose |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| **1 Spawn** | Avatar materializes in a dim laundry room; a “Laundry Dragon” lurks. | Externalizes anxiety. |
| **2 Quest Pick** | Example prompt: *“Rescue your favourite hoodie from the Sock Vortex.”* | Gives a single clear objective. |
| **3 Mini-Games** | a) **Color Sort** – drag garments to colour bins  <br> b) **Detergent Select** – choose calming scent  <br> c) **Spin-Cycle Tap** – rhythmic tapping cleans washer | Breaks the task into tiny wins; each mini-game = dopamine hit. |
| **4 Victory** | Room brightens, dragon shrinks, avatar dons clean hoodie. | Positive visual closure. |
| **5 IRL Prompt** | *“Want to run a 5-min load before continuing?”* | Bridges game success → real-world action. |

## 🔄 Loop & Reward Logic

1. **Each Complete Cycle** → `+1 Clean-Streak`.  
2. **Streak = 3** (first week) → *Token 1*  +  *NFT Lv 1* (3 % practitioner discount).  
3. Following weeks raise the requirement: **3 → 6 → 9** consecutive cycles before the **same** token drops.  
4. Missed day **resets streak** but never removes earned tokens (progress = resilient).  
5. Tokens feed into global **HNT** wallet; NFTs unlock new therapy rooms & discounts.

## 🌱 Real-Life Integration Examples

| IRL Challenge | In-Game Nudge |
|---------------|---------------|
| “Washer done, never moved to dryer.” | Dragon re-appears holding a soggy sock ➜ *“Let’s finish that spin!”* |
| “Pile of clean clothes not folded.” | New “Folding Mastery” mini-game unlocks with soothing beats. |
| “Zero motivation today.” | Game auto-scales to a **one-sock quest** → still counts toward streak. |
