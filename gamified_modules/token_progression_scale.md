# HypnoNeuro – Progressive Token Scaling Logic

## 🔁 Overview

HypnoNeuro’s token system is designed to **reward mastery, not dependency**. Users must complete self-guided game loops (e.g., Hypnosis Room, Mind Loop) consecutively to earn tokens that unlock deeper levels of healing. Each level’s progression mirrors therapeutic endurance and cognitive commitment, with increasing difficulty over time.

## 🎮 Level 1 – Hypnosis Room

- **Goal:** Build self-regulation and focus through gamified therapy.
- **Mechanic:** Complete **3 full game sessions in a row** without missing to earn 1 token.
- **Token Reward:**
  - 3 sessions → 1 token
  - Token unlocks **Level 2 access** and **NFT: L1 (3% discount)**

## 📈 Progressive Scaling Logic

| Week | Requirement                        | Outcome                          |
|------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| 1    | 3 consecutive L1 sessions          | Earn 1 token                     |
| 2    | 6 total sessions (3 per week × 2)  | Earn 1 token                     |
| 3    | 9 total sessions (3 per week × 3)  | Earn 1 token                     |
| 4+   | Mastery achieved → return to 3/wk  | Maintain momentum or upgrade     |

- If user **misses a session**, the streak resets to **Week 1 rules**.
- Missed sessions result in **no token**, no level advancement.

---

## 🧠 Developer Notes

- Streaks should be tracked off-chain via session completion timestamp validation.
- Each successful game loop completion (e.g., Hypnosis Room → “Success” screen) counts as one session.
- Game modules should display:
  - **Progress bar** (e.g., “2 of 3 sessions completed for Token”)
  - **Weekly token threshold** (scaled automatically)

---

## 🎁 NFT Redemption Logic (After Mastery)

- Users earning:
  - **3 Tokens** → **NFT Level 1** (3% discount)
  - **6 Tokens** → **NFT Level 2** (6% discount)
  - **9 Tokens** → **NFT Level 3** (9% discount)

These NFTs can be used in-app to **redeem discounts for professional services** via the EncryptHealth portal.

---

## 📜 Rationale

This structure:
- Rewards **self-mastery** and independence.
- Prevents passive reward farming.
- Mimics therapeutic growth cycles and builds consistency.
- Gradually transitions users toward **real-world application** of their emotional regulation tools.
