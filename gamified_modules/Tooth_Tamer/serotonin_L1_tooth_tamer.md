# 🦷 Level 1 – Tooth Tamer (Serotonin System Entry)

A Level 1 Hypnosis Room module supporting **serotonin balance** through trauma-informed oral hygiene routines.

---

## 🧠 Why Dental Care?

- **Oral pathogens impact the brain:** Harmful bacteria from inflamed gums can enter the bloodstream and travel to the brain, increasing inflammation and affecting mood regulation.
- **Routine = neurochemical rhythm:** Brushing and flossing at consistent times promotes serotonin production, which thrives on structure.
- **Low-functioning states disrupt hygiene:** Depression and trauma often lead to neglecting personal care, compounding mental and physical health issues.

---

## 🧬 Neurotransmitter Target: **Serotonin**

- Promotes **calm, routine, and stability**.
- Most prescribed psychiatric drug class (SSRIs), associated with the highest suicide-related adverse event reports in FAERS data (2020–2024), highlighting the need for non-pharmaceutical interventions.
- Linked to motivation for **hygiene, appetite, and sleep**.
- This module introduces **habit loops** that reinforce consistency in self-care and reduce reliance on pharmaceutical cycles.

## 📈 Progression & Neurotransmitter Logic

This module is part of a **neurotransmitter-aligned progression**:

| Room Level | Neurotransmitter | Rationale |
|------------|------------------|-----------|
| **L1**     | **Serotonin**    | Highest prescriptions and suicide rates (SSRIs) |
| **L2**     | **GABA**         | 2nd highest medication-related death rate (e.g., benzodiazepine class); linked to sedation, anxiety, and withdrawal risk |
| **L3**     | **Dopamine**     | Motivation loss, substance use relapse, and behavioral disengagement |
