# 🌀 Laundry Loop – Behavioral Reset Cycle

The "Laundry Loop" is a gamified metaphor for users who repeatedly start over in their healing process — a reflection of real-world behavioral relapse and avoidance. HypnoNeuro embraces this loop to **build resilience** through **gentle repetition**, not punishment.

---

## 🧠 Why It Matters

- Many users feel shame when restarting their healing journey.
- HypnoNeuro normalizes this cycle and rewards re-engagement.
- The loop helps build long-term neural patterns for resilience.

## 🔁 Loop Logic (Cycle)

1. **Begin Session** → Game or guided practice  
2. **Partial Completion** → Exit or avoid finish  
3. **System detects reset** → Loop restarts with minor token delay  
4. **3 Restarts triggers a new AI reflection prompt**  
5. **Streak resumes after 2 full completions**

---

## 🎮 Gamification Mechanics

- No tokens lost for re-entering the loop.  
- A counter tracks how many “laundry loads” (retries) occur.  
- After every 3 loops, players get a self-reflection NFT or gentle AI nudge.  
- Completing 2 full runs after a loop earns a **"Bounce Back Bonus"** token.
