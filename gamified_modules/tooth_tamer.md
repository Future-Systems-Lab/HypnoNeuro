### 🧠 Rationale & Methodology

Brushing teeth can feel overwhelming for users in low-functioning, depressive, or trauma states. Executive dysfunction often turns small routines into seemingly insurmountable tasks. This gamified module rewires approach behavior using rhythm, feedback, and micro-challenges.

- Builds **dopamine reward loops** through tempo-based brushing.
- Provides **non-shaming, low-stakes entry points** for hygiene routines.
- Promotes consistency over perfection — core to trauma-informed care.
