## 🪥 Tooth Tamer — Dental Mini-Quest (Level 1)

*A trauma-informed, avatar-guided brushing sequence for restoring daily oral care habits and educating users on the mental health impact of neglected hygiene.*

---

### 🧠 Why It Matters  

When brushing feels like a pointless task, users may not realize that **oral bacteria directly affect the brain**.  
Plaque buildup is more than cosmetic — it's a **living biofilm of harmful organisms**. When gums bleed, it opens a portal for these bacteria to enter the bloodstream, traveling from the mouth to the heart, gut, and brain with every heartbeat.  
This contributes to **neuroinflammation**, worsens **mood instability**, and disrupts dopamine, GABA, and serotonin regulation — compounding mental health symptoms.

### 🎮 Gameplay: Guided Brushing Routine  

- **Avatar Demonstration:**  
  - Uses an electric toothbrush with a small round head.  
  - Begins in the **upper right quadrant**, brushing the outer surfaces of the posterior teeth.  
  - Sequence continues: upper → lower → anterior → inner surfaces.  
  - Emphasis on **gentle gumline brushing**, where animated plaque fades visibly as brushing progresses.  

- **Voiceover Guidance Includes:**  
  - “Bleeding gums are not normal — they allow harmful microbes into your bloodstream.”  
  - “That white coating on your tongue is not just food — it’s thousands of bacterial strains.”  
  - “Bacteria in your mouth can reach your brain in under one minute.”  

- **IRL Prompt:**  
  - “Follow the avatar's motion. Can you complete just the upper right today?”  
  - Milestones like reaching the upper anterior or completing one full arch **trigger gamified micro-wins**.

### 🧪 Oral ↔ Mood Reinforcement

  - *“You’re clearing the path to mental clarity.”*  
  - *“Each circle is a circuit — brain and body in sync.”*
