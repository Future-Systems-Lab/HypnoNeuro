# 🪥 Tooth Tamer — Dental Mini-Quest  
**Therapy Tier:** Level 1 – Hypnosis Room | **Neurotransmitter Focus:** Dopamine (motivation & reward)

---

## 🧠 Therapeutic Rationale

Brushing teeth can feel futile or exhausting for users in depressive or trauma states.  
Simulating the routine inside a game:

1. Lowers the activation energy required to start.  
2. Converts micro-actions into immediate dopamine rewards.  
3. Builds repetition → mastery loops that carry over to real life.  

> **Why dopamine?** Small, timed rewards for every correct brush stroke keep the
> brain’s motivation circuitry engaged, turning “just 2 mins” into a meaningful win.

## 🎮 Level-by-Level Design

| Level | Gameplay Focus | IRL Transfer | Education Call-outs |
|-------|----------------|--------------|---------------------|
| **L1 (Demo)** | **Watch & Mirror** an avatar using an **electric round-head toothbrush** — 1 min per arch (Upper Right ➡ Upper Left ➡ Lower Left ➡ Lower Right).<br>Facials first, then linguals. | User mimics movements at home in real time.<br>*Prompt:* “Match the circles you see on-screen.” | Voice-over explains that **bleeding gums are open portals** to the bloodstream and that the “fuzzy film” on teeth/tongue is a living biofilm that can travel mouth → heart → brain each heartbeat. |
| **L2 (Skill Upgrade)** | Adds **gentle tongue-scraper mini-game** after brushing. | User cleans tongue IRL. | Mentions taste-bud clarity & breath benefits; warns about harmful bacteria reservoirs. |
| **L3 (Expert)** | Introduces **flossing rhythm challenge**: player taps/holds to guide floss in a **C-shape under the gumline** around each tooth (C-loop subgingival technique). | User flosses **two real contacts** while the avatar performs a full-mouth demo. | Voice-over explains that floss must “hug the tooth like a letter C” to sweep under the gums, not just snap between contacts. |

### 🔥 Bonus Craft Station (Optional Side Quest)

*Unlocks after first complete weekly streak.*

- Learn to make **natural toothpaste** (baking soda + xylitol + peppermint oil).  
- Explains avoidance of SLS, triclosan, and other endocrine disruptors that may interfere with neurotransmitter balance.

## 🏆 Reward & Token Logic

| Action | Reward |
|--------|--------|
| Finish L1 demo (2-min brush) | +1 Hygiene Token |
| 3 consecutive L1 completions | **Clean-Streak × 3**  → *Token A* → **NFT Lv 1 (3 % discount)** |
| Complete all three levels in a week | *Token B* → **NFT Lv 2 (6 % discount)** |
| Weekly streak requirement escalates **3 → 6 → 9** to encourage mastery. |
| Missed day resets streak but never removes earned tokens. |

Tokens deposit to the user’s **HNT wallet**; NFTs unlock higher therapy rooms and practitioner discounts.

##### 🦷 Personalized IRL Prompt (L1)

> **Step 1 – Scan Your Smile:**  
> *“Snap one clear photo of your upper teeth. The game will auto-map the surfaces you still have — skipping missing teeth and respecting crowns or implants.”*  

**Why?**  
- Not every player has all 32 teeth; numbers can confuse or shame.  
- A quick photo lets the AI avatar build a realistic 3-D “mouth map.”  
- Data is **locally encrypted**, then abstracted into an *“arch timeline”* (no raw photo stored on-chain).

---

#### 🤖 How It Works

| Phase | Action | Benefit |
|-------|--------|---------|
| **Capture** | Smartphone cam snaps upper arch; on-device ML detects each tooth, restoration, or gap. | Personalizes brushing zones. |
| **Map** | Algorithm builds a **surface heat map** — highlighting high-plaque risk areas. | Sets the avatar’s brush-order path. |
| **Sync** | Avatar mirrors *exactly* the user’s dentition: missing teeth are skipped, crowns flagged for gentler pressure. | Avoids confusion & increases compliance. |

---

### 🦷 Adaptive Brushing Path

1. **High-risk quadrant first** (posterior surfaces flagged as “red”)  
2. **Moderate-risk** (yellow)  
3. **Low-risk** (green)  

Each completed zone triggers a **celebratory particle burst** and verbal praise:  
*“Pressure perfect — plaque defeated!”*

---

### 🌿 Naturopathic Care Suggestions

After the scan, the module surfaces **plant-based oral-care tips** matching the player’s needs:

| Condition Detected | Naturopathic Method | Mini-Tutorial |
|--------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| Frequent bleeding | **Rinses:** warm salt + thyme tea | 30-sec rinse animation |
| Visible calculus | **Oil pulling** with sesame or coconut | 1-min swish demo |
| Acid-wear risk | **Mineral paste** (calcium carbonate + xylitol) | Mix-your-own mini-game |

All suggestions emphasize **non-fluoride, non-animal, SLS-free** solutions.

### 🔐 Privacy & Data

- Photos never leave the user’s device; only anonymized tooth-surface vectors are stored.  
- Users must opt-in and can delete the scan at any time.  
- No biometric data is written on-chain.

🎉 **Every custom pass you finish becomes a milestone** — no matter how many teeth remain.

## 📚 Key Educational Messages

1. **Bleeding gums = blood-stream gateway.**  
2. **Biofilm = bacterial city** that circulates if not mechanically removed.  
3. **Consistent 2-min sessions** beat occasional deep cleans.  
4. **Natural formulas** avoid chemical foaming agents that can irritate the mouth–brain axis.
