## 🪥 Tooth Tamer — Dental Mini-Quest (Level 1 – Hypnosis Room)

*A trauma-informed hygiene loop to restore daily self-care through guided oral health practices.*

---

### 🧠 Why Brushing Is Hard

Brushing teeth may seem simple — but for individuals in mental health crisis or neurochemical imbalance, it can feel futile, overwhelming, or disconnected from outcome. Shame, fatigue, sensory overload, or executive dysfunction often get in the way.

**Tooth Tamer** transforms oral care into a guided micro-quest that reinforces identity, health autonomy, and nervous system safety.

### 🎮 Gameplay: Level 1 – Brushing Routine

| Stage | Gameplay Action | Therapeutic Purpose |
|-------|------------------|----------------------|
| **Spawn** | Avatar appears in a misty bathroom mirror | Establishes daily rhythm cue |
| **Start Routine** | Avatar uses a **round-head electric toothbrush** | Models trauma-informed pacing |
| **Guided Path** | Brushing begins at **upper right quadrant** (1–5), then upper front, then upper left | Encourages posterior access first |
| **Instructional Prompts** | Narration explains the importance of gum-level care, angle, pressure | Educates gently on oral-systemic health |
| **Neuro-Informed Voiceovers** | Explains how **bleeding gums = direct bloodstream entry** for bacteria | Creates urgency without shame |
| **IRL Cue** | "Try brushing just your upper right quadrant for 60 seconds." | Bridges in-game to real-world behavior |

---

### 🧪 Educational Integration

- Users learn that **biofilm and tongue coating** harbor bacteria that cycle from **mouth → bloodstream → heart → brain**.
- This repeated exposure can affect **inflammation, mood, immunity**, and even cognition.
- Real-time brushing by the avatar syncs with **breath** and **neuro-soothing narration**.

### 🧼 Personalized Adaptations (Coming Soon)

- Avatar maps adapt to user-uploaded photos of their mouth.
- Identifies missing teeth, restorations, or bridges.
- Suggests gentle, **natural products** tailored to the user's dentition.
- Avoids all animal-derived products and harsh chemicals linked to neurotransmitter disruption.

### 🔒 Privacy & Use
