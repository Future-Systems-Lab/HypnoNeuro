# 🪥 Tooth Tamer — Dental Mini-Quest  
**Therapy Tier:** Level 1 – Hypnosis Room | **Neurotransmitter Focus:** Dopamine (motivation & reward)

---

## 🧠 Therapeutic Rationale

Brushing teeth can feel futile or exhausting for users in depressive or trauma states.  
Simulating the routine inside a game:

1. Lowers the activation energy required to start.  
2. Converts micro-actions into immediate dopamine rewards.  
3. Builds repetition → mastery loops that carry over to real life.  

> **Why dopamine?** Small, timed rewards for every correct brush stroke keep the
> brain’s motivation circuitry engaged, turning “just 2 mins” into a meaningful win.

## 🎮 Level-by-Level Design

| Level | Gameplay Focus | IRL Transfer | Education Call-outs |
|-------|----------------|--------------|---------------------|
| **L1 (Demo)** | **Watch & Mirror** an avatar using an **electric round-head toothbrush** — 1 min per arch (Upper Right ➡ Upper Left ➡ Lower Left ➡ Lower Right).<br>Facials first, then linguals. | User mimics movements at home in real time.<br>*Prompt:* “Match the circles you see on-screen.” | Voice-over explains that **bleeding gums are open portals** to the bloodstream and that the “fuzzy film” on teeth/tongue is a living biofilm that can travel mouth → heart → brain each heartbeat. |
| **L2 (Skill Upgrade)** | Adds **gentle tongue-scraper mini-game** after brushing. | User cleans tongue IRL. | Mentions taste-bud clarity & breath benefits; warns about harmful bacteria reservoirs. |
| **L3 (Expert)** | Introduces **flossing rhythm challenge**: player taps/holds to guide floss in a **C-shape under the gumline** around each tooth (C-loop subgingival technique). | User flosses **two real contacts** while the avatar performs a full-mouth demo. | Voice-over explains that floss must “hug the tooth like a letter C” to sweep under the gums, not just snap between contacts. |

## 📚 Key Educational Messages

1. **Bleeding gums = blood-stream gateway.**  
2. **Biofilm = bacterial city** that circulates if not mechanically removed.  
3. **Consistent 2-min sessions** beat occasional deep cleans.  
4. **Natural formulas** avoid chemical foaming agents that can irritate the mouth–brain axis.
