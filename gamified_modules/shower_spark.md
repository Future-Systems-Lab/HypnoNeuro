# 🧼 Shower Spark – Hygiene Starter (Level 1: Hypnosis Room)  
**Neurotransmitter Target: GABA** – Calming, grounding, stress relief

---

## 🧠 Therapeutic Rationale  
For individuals facing depression, anxiety, or trauma recovery, **basic hygiene can feel overwhelming**.  
This module creates a **low-stakes virtual rehearsal** that gently mirrors the activation energy required to begin real-life care routines.

Activating GABA pathways through calming rituals (scents, steam, soothing voice) promotes a state of **safety and stillness**—a neurochemical cue to move from freeze to flow.
