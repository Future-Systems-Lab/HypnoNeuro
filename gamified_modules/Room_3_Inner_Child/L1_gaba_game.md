## 🧸 Level 1 – Inner Child Room: GABA & Safe Comfort Rituals

**Neurotransmitter Focus:** GABA  
**Theme:** Building calm and safety through inner child visualization paired with a calming micro-action to support GABA pathways.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To help users reconnect with **feelings of safety and calm often lost during trauma and mental health crises**, using inner child visualization and a gentle self-soothing ritual to naturally support GABA pathways.

**Benzodiazepines, commonly prescribed for GABA support, are the second most deadly psychiatric drug class in FAERS data (2020–2024) due to overdose and dependency.** This module offers a **safe, non-pharma alternative** for GABA support during recovery.

---

## 🧠 Rationale

- **GABA calms the nervous system, reduces overstimulation, and promotes relaxation.**
- Trauma disrupts the body’s safety signals and GABA functioning.
- Comfort rituals paired with visualization can calm the nervous system and support natural GABA production.
- Consistent micro-actions create safety and calm without medication reliance.
