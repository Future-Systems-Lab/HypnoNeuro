## 🧸 Level 1 – Inner Child Room: Dopamine & Small Wins

**Neurotransmitter Focus:** Dopamine  
**Theme:** Rebuilding motivation and reward pathways through inner child connection and micro-success actions.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To help users **rebuild motivation, self-trust, and reward pathways disrupted during trauma and mental health crises** using inner child connection and simple, achievable micro-actions that support dopamine activation.

**Stimulants and antipsychotics, used for dopamine-related conditions, are linked with dependency, motivational collapse, and deaths in FAERS data (2020–2024).** This module offers a **safe, non-pharma alternative** to support dopamine pathways through micro-successes.

---

## 🧠 Rationale


- **Dopamine supports motivation, focus, and reward.**
- Trauma and depression can lead to neglect of personal hygiene.
- Changing clothes is an easy, non-overwhelming micro-action to stimulate dopamine safely.

## 🎮 Gameplay: “Fresh Start”

| Stage | In-Game Action | Purpose |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| 1 | Avatar looks disheveled and low energy | Represents current state |
| 2 | User selects an outfit for the avatar | Builds agency and choice |
| 3 | Breath cue: “Inhale... Exhale as you change.” | Adds mindfulness |
| 4 | Avatar brightens, posture improves | Visual dopamine reward |
| 5 | Pop-up: “Small wins → Dopamine → Motivation” | Connects science to action |
| 6 | IRL Prompt: “Put on a fresh shirt today.” | Connects game to action |

- **Dopamine fuels motivation, focus, and goal-directed behavior.**
- Trauma disrupts dopamine reward circuits and self-activation.
- Inner child nurturing combined with micro-actions helps rebuild dopamine pathways safely.
- Small, consistent wins restore motivation without external pressure.
