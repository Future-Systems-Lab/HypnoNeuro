## 🧸 Level 1 – Inner Child Room: Serotonin & Self-Compassion

**Neurotransmitter Focus:** Serotonin  
**Theme:** Rebuilding stability, self-trust, and nurturing rhythms through inner child connection and micro-actions.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To help users reconnect with **self-nurturing habits often abandoned during trauma and mental health crises**, using inner child visualization and comforting micro-actions to support serotonin pathways.

**SSRIs, prescribed for serotonin-related concerns, are the leading psychiatric drug class associated with suicide-related deaths in FAERS data (2020–2024).** This module offers a **safe, non-pharma pathway** to support serotonin systems using inner child-focused behavioral activation.

---

## 🧠 Rationale

- **Serotonin supports calm, structure, and emotional regulation.**
- Trauma disrupts daily rhythms, self-trust, and nurturing behaviors.
- Inner child visualization and comforting micro-actions rebuild these pathways gently.
- Consistent micro-actions stabilize serotonin pathways naturally.
