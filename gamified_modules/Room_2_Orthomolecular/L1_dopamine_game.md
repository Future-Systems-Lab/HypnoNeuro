## 🥗 Level 1 – Orthomolecular Medicine: Dopamine & Motivation Foods

**Neurotransmitter Focus:** Dopamine  
**Theme:** Supporting motivation, focus, and engagement through targeted nutrition to rebuild dopamine pathways naturally.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To help users **support dopamine pathways during mental health recovery using nutrient-dense foods** that aid motivation, task initiation, and focus.

**Stimulants and antipsychotics, commonly prescribed for dopamine-related conditions, are associated with dependency, motivational disruption, and deaths according to FAERS data (2020–2024).** This module offers a **safe, nutrition-based alternative** to strengthen dopamine pathways during recovery.

---

## 🧠 Rationale

- **Dopamine drives motivation, focus, and goal-directed behaviors.**
- Trauma and poor nutrition disrupt dopamine synthesis and receptor sensitivity.
- Protein-rich foods with tyrosine (dopamine precursor) support dopamine pathways.
- Magnesium and B-vitamins further support dopamine balance and mental energy.
- Nutrition offers a non-pharmaceutical pathway for motivation rebuilding.

## 🎮 Gameplay: “Fuel for Focus”

| Stage | In-Game Action | Purpose |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| 1 | Avatar in a bright kitchen with motivational music | Sets an activating tone |
| 2 | Player sorts foods high in tyrosine: pumpkin seeds, almonds, tofu, lentils | Builds nutrient awareness |
| 3 | Player selects 3 foods for a \"focus plate\" | Encourages intentional selection |
| 4 | Pop-up: “Pumpkin seeds → Tyrosine → Dopamine support” | Connects nutrients to motivation |
| 5 | Avatar eats, energy glow and posture improve | Visual dopamine feedback |
| 6 | IRL Prompt: “Add one dopamine-supporting food to a meal today.” | Connects game learning to real action |
