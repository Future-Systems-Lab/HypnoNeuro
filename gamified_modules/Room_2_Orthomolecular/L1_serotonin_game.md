## 🍇 Level 1 – Orthomolecular Nutrition: Blueberry Cheesecake Smoothie

**Neurotransmitter Focus:** Serotonin  
**Theme:** Supporting emotional stability through an easy, plant-based smoothie that uses dark berries to naturally support serotonin pathways.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To help users **rebuild emotional stability and routine during recovery** with a **simple, serotonin-supportive micro-action: preparing a plant-based blueberry cheesecake smoothie.**

This module reframes **nutrition as mental health support**, providing a comforting, low-barrier ritual users can rely on during moments of low motivation.

## 🧠 Rationale

- **Serotonin supports mood stability, routine, and restful sleep.**
- Anthocyanins in dark berries (blueberries, blackberries) can support serotonin pathways and reduce inflammation.
- Gut inflammation can disrupt serotonin production, impacting mood.
- Plant-based alternatives reduce potential inflammatory triggers from dairy, supporting gut-brain balance.
- A simple smoothie routine is fast, low-pressure, and nourishing.
