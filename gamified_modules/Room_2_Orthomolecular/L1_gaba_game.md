## 🍵 Level 1 – Orthomolecular Nutrition: Warm Turmeric Latte

**Neurotransmitter Focus:** GABA  
**Theme:** Supporting calm and reducing overstimulation through a soothing, anti-inflammatory turmeric latte ritual that naturally supports GABA pathways during recovery.


---

## 🎯 Objective

To help users **establish a gentle, calming evening or morning ritual** using a warm turmeric latte to **support GABA pathways naturally, reduce inflammation, and promote relaxation** without pharmaceutical intervention.

This module reframes **nutrition as nervous system support**, providing a **low-barrier micro-action** to reduce anxiety and overstimulation through warmth, routine, and nourishment.


---

## 🧠 Rationale

- **GABA is the body’s calming neurotransmitter, reducing anxiety and overstimulation.**
- Stress, poor diet, and inflammation can reduce GABA activity.
- Turmeric contains **curcumin, an anti-inflammatory compound** that supports gut-brain health.
- Warm beverages paired with mindfulness can stimulate the vagus nerve, aiding relaxation.
- Magnesium-rich plant milks (oat, almond) further support GABA pathways.
- **Plant-based alternatives reduce inflammation triggers that may impact mental health stability.**
