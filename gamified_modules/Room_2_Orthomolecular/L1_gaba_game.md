## 🥗 Level 1 – Orthomolecular Medicine: Dark Berries & GABA Support

**Neurotransmitter Focus:** GABA  
**Theme:** Supporting calm and nervous system regulation through dark, anthocyanin-rich foods in a simple, actionable nutrition micro-task.


---

## 🎯 Objective

To help users **calm nervous system overstimulation and reduce anxiety** through simple, daily inclusion of dark berries or similar anthocyanin-rich foods to naturally support GABA pathways.


---

## 🧠 Rationale


- **GABA is the body’s calming neurotransmitter, reducing anxiety and overstimulation.**
- Stress, poor diet, and inflammation can reduce GABA activity.
- Turmeric contains **curcumin, an anti-inflammatory compound** that supports gut-brain health.
- Warm beverages paired with mindfulness can stimulate the vagus nerve, aiding relaxation.
- Magnesium-rich plant milks (oat, almond) further support GABA pathways.
- **Plant-based alternatives reduce inflammation triggers that may impact mental health stability.**
