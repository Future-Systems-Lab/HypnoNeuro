## 🍵 Level 1 – Orthomolecular Nutrition: Warm Turmeric Latte

**Neurotransmitter Focus:** GABA  
**Theme:** Supporting calm and reducing overstimulation through a soothing, anti-inflammatory turmeric latte ritual that naturally supports GABA pathways during recovery.

---

## 🥗 Level 1 – Orthomolecular Medicine: GABA & Dark Foods

**Neurotransmitter Focus:** GABA  
**Theme:** Supporting calm and nervous system regulation through targeted nutrition with dark, anthocyanin-rich, magnesium-dense foods.


---

## 🎯 Objective

To empower users to **support GABA pathways naturally using specific foods** that reduce inflammation, calm the nervous system, and address nutrient deficiencies often present during mental health crises.

**Benzodiazepines, commonly prescribed for GABA-related conditions, are the second most deadly psychiatric drug class according to FAERS data (2020–2024), with high rates of overdose and dependency.** This module offers a **safe, nutritional alternative** for GABA support during recovery.


---

## 🧠 Rationale

- **GABA is the body’s calming neurotransmitter, reducing anxiety and overstimulation.**
- Stress, poor diet, and inflammation can reduce GABA activity.
- Turmeric contains **curcumin, an anti-inflammatory compound** that supports gut-brain health.
- Warm beverages paired with mindfulness can stimulate the vagus nerve, aiding relaxation.
- Magnesium-rich plant milks (oat, almond) further support GABA pathways.
- **Plant-based alternatives reduce inflammation triggers that may impact mental health stability.**
