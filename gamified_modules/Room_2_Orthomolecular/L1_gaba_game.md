## 🥗 Level 1 – Orthomolecular Medicine: GABA & Dark Foods

**Neurotransmitter Focus:** GABA  
**Theme:** Supporting calm and nervous system regulation through targeted nutrition with dark, anthocyanin-rich, magnesium-dense foods.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To empower users to **support GABA pathways naturally using specific foods** that reduce inflammation, calm the nervous system, and address nutrient deficiencies often present during mental health crises.

**Benzodiazepines, commonly prescribed for GABA-related conditions, are the second most deadly psychiatric drug class according to FAERS data (2020–2024), with high rates of overdose and dependency.** This module offers a **safe, nutritional alternative** for GABA support during recovery.

---

## 🧠 Rationale

- **GABA calms the nervous system and reduces overstimulation and anxiety.**
- Trauma, stress, and poor diets can reduce GABA synthesis.
- Anthocyanins and magnesium lower inflammation and support GABA pathways.
- Using nutrition creates an **accessible, non-pharma pathway** for daily nervous system support.
