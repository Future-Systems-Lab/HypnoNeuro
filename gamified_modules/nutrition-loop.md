## 🧠 Why a Food-for-Mood Game?

- **Decision-fatigue & executive dysfunction:** Choosing, shopping, and cooking can feel impossible during depressive or anxious episodes.  
- **Nutrient–neurotransmitter link:** Tryptophan, tyrosine, B-vitamins, and magnesium directly influence serotonin, dopamine, and GABA.  
- **Educational rehearsal:** Repeating small, low-pressure food tasks in-game trains the brain to make “good-enough” choices in real life.

## 🎮 Core Gameplay Flow

| Stage | In-Game Action | Purpose |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| **1 Spawn** | Avatar enters a cozy virtual kitchen; an “Empty-Fridge Gremlin” sighs loudly. | Externalizes food anxiety. |
| **2 Quest Pick** | Prompt example: *“Build a Mood-Boost Lunchbox for a Rainy Day.”* | Single clear mission. |
| **3 Mini-Games** | a) **Food Dash** – swipe ingredients into a basket (color-coded by nutrient: green = magnesium, yellow = B-vitamins). <br> b) **Mood-Match Quiz** – pair foods with feelings (e.g., turkey ➜ calm, banana ➜ focus). <br> c) **No-Cook Plate** – arrange three snack items on a plate within 60 s. | Teaches “snack-stacking” and nutrient cues. |
| **4 Victory** | Kitchen lights up; Gremlin shrinks; avatar enjoys a glowing snack. | Positive closure. |
| **5 IRL Prompt** | *“Grab one tryptophan snack (e.g., Greek yogurt) IRL to lock in today’s buff?”* | Bridges game → real life. |

## 🔄 Loop & Reward Logic

1. **Each Prepared Plate** → `+1 Nutrition-Streak`.  
2. **Streak = 3** (first week) → *Token 2* + *NFT Lv 2* (6 % practitioner discount).  
3. Subsequent weeks: requirement increases **3 → 6 → 9** plates before the **same** token can drop again, reinforcing autonomy.  
4. Missed day resets the streak but never removes earned tokens.  
5. Tokens funnel to the user’s **HNT** wallet; NFTs unlock higher-tier rooms & practitioner discounts.

## 🌱 Real-Life Integration Examples

| IRL Challenge | In-Game Nudge |
|---------------|---------------|
| “Fridge is empty, can’t cook.” | Gremlin offers a *“3-item no-cook quest”* (e.g., canned beans + apple + nuts). |
| “Can’t decide what to buy.” | Food Dash auto-generates a colour-coded grocery list emailed to the user. |
| “Zero appetite today.” | Game suggests *“Liquid Mood Mix”* mini-game: blend banana, milk (tryptophan), and cocoa (polyphenols). |
