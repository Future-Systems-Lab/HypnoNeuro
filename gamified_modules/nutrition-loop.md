# 🥗 Nutrition Loop – Mood Meals  
*A Level-2 Mental Wellness Room module that transforms “finding food” into a low-pressure, healing routine.*

## 🧠 Why a Food Game?

- **Mental fatigue and overwhelm:** For many struggling with mental health, even choosing what to eat can feel paralyzing.  
- **Low-energy support:** When motivation is low, nutrition often collapses first — yet it’s one of the most direct ways to affect energy, clarity, and mood.  
- **Rehearsal for daily wins:** This module provides a safe space to practice choosing plant-based, nutrient-dense combinations without pressure, guilt, or perfectionism.

## 🎮 Core Gameplay Flow

| Stage | In-Game Action | Purpose |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| **1 Spawn** | Avatar wakes up in a softly lit digital kitchen; an “Empty Fridge Gremlin” paces anxiously nearby. | Personifies food stress. |
| **2 Quest Pick** | Sample mission: *“Build a Calm-Focus Snack Box to Start the Day.”* | Offers focused, achievable goal. |
| **3 Mini-Games** | a) **Nutrient Dash** – Tap or swipe to gather whole, plant-based foods (e.g., oats, seeds, berries, greens). <br> b) **Mood Pairing** – Match food groups with energy states (e.g., complex carbs → steady, leafy greens → uplift). <br> c) **Snack Stack** – Combine 2–3 no-prep items into a “mood plate.” | Simulates real-life snack assembly and decision confidence. |
| **4 Victory** | Kitchen glows; Gremlin calms; avatar gains “Focus Aura” and completes mission. | Visual closure + emotional boost. |
| **5 IRL Prompt** | *“Try a no-cook combo: banana + almond butter + pumpkin seeds. Want to give it a shot IRL?”* | Gentle cue to mirror success. |

## 🔄 Loop & Reward Logic

1. **Each Completed Meal Module** → `+1 Nutrition Loop`.  
2. **Loop = 3 in a week** → *Token 2* + *NFT Lv 2* (6% discount for wellness services).  
3. Progression = 3 → 6 → 9 loops before repeated token drops.  
4. Missed day resets loop, but earned tokens and NFTs stay.  
5. All progress contributes to the **HNT** wallet and therapy unlocks.

## 🌱 Real-Life Tie-Ins

| IRL Scenario | In-Game Response |
|--------------|------------------|
| “Can’t think what to eat.” | Game selects a pre-built mood plate: e.g., “Clarity Kit: walnuts + spinach + quinoa cracker.” |
| “Fridge is empty.” | Offers a shelf-stable food challenge (e.g., oats, raisins, peanut butter). |
| “Not hungry / no appetite.” | Suggests hydration-based mini-game (e.g., build an infused water blend for energy). |
