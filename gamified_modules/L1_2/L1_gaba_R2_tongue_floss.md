# 🦷 Level 1 – Tongue + Floss (GABA System Entry)

**Module:** Tooth Tamer  



---

## 🎯 Objective  
This GABA-focused entry level introduces players to the connection between **oral stagnation** and **mental overstimulation**.  
By using simple tools like a tongue scraper and floss, players begin a ritual that **activates the vagus nerve**, reduces systemic inflammation, and sets the tone for calm.

## 🎮 In-Game Features

### 🪥 1. Tongue Scraper Mini-Game  
- Swipe to scrape buildup on a 3D tongue avatar.  
- Animation shows calming “fog” lifting off the surface.  
- Bacteria pulses fade into blue once cleared.

### 🧵 2. Floss Feedback Rhythm  
- Players drag floss tool in a gentle C-loop.  
- Each contact creates a soft “ping” and breath cue.  
- Skipped contacts trigger a “pause + re-center” message (non-punitive).

### 💡 3. GABA Gauge (Visual Meter)  
- Slow, consistent movements raise a visual “calm bar.”  
- Erratic rushing shows a flickering signal → encourages return to stillness.

## 🧪 Why Bacteria Disrupt Calm

Oral bacteria aren’t just cosmetic — they’re **chemical agitators**.  
When plaque and tongue coatings aren’t cleared, bacteria release **endotoxins** (like LPS) into the bloodstream.  
These toxins:

- Increase **inflammatory cytokines**  
- Suppress **vagus nerve signaling**  
- Disrupt **GABA synthesis** in the gut and brain

> This leads to poor sleep, jaw clenching, nervous tension, and even panic-like symptoms — often **misdiagnosed as anxiety disorders**.

Tooth Tamer reframes flossing and tongue scraping as **mental hygiene**, not just dental care.

## 🧠 GABA System Focus

> GABA is the **body’s natural tranquilizer** — it slows activity, relaxes muscles, and balances sensory input.  
> When oral inflammation is high (especially from ignored areas like the tongue and interdental plaque), immune signals rise and **GABA function drops**, contributing to restlessness and anxiety.

This level helps players *reclaim calm* from the inside out — one swipe at a time.

## 💡 IRL Prompt  
“Do one tongue scrape and one floss contact. Move slowly. Breathe out while you floss.”

- This isn’t about ‘cleaning it all’ — it’s about *interrupting chaos with calm action*.  
- Earn XP by pacing, not by perfection.

## 🎁 Token Earning Logic

✅ **Do this routine at least 3 times in a week** to earn a GABA-system token.

- Tokens unlock progress in the platform  
- **3 tokens = next level access**  
- **Tokens = therapy discounts**, deeper room access, and community badges

> This isn’t about intensity — it’s about **gentle, consistent repetition**.  
> Every small act of calm builds a larger shift in your nervous system.

## 🔎 Systemic Insight

> Benzodiazepines and other GABA-targeting medications are the **second most common class** of psychiatric drugs associated with **overdose and death** in U.S. safety data.  
> This level helps players build GABA naturally — with a toothbrush, a breath, and a few seconds of daily stillness.
