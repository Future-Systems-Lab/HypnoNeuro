## 🎯 Objective

HypnoNeuro’s gamified system restores **daily rhythms often lost during mental health crises**, including:

✅ Dental care  
✅ Personal hygiene care  
✅ Nutrition care

by delivering them in **safe, engaging micro-games** within a **trauma-informed environment**.

---

## 🗂️ Structure

Each **Level (L#)** represents a week of structured healing.  
Each **Room (R#)** represents a modality:

- 🌀 **Room 1: Hypnosis Room** (Dental Care)
- 🥗 **Room 2: Orthomolecular Medicine** (Nutrition)
- 👶 **Room 3: Inner Child Healing** (Personal Hygiene & Self-Activation)

Each level covers **Serotonin, GABA, and Dopamine systems** in order of real-world safety and public health priorities.

---

## 🧠 Neurotransmitter Priorities

1️⃣ **Serotonin:** Stability and calm. (SSRIs = highest adverse event and death rates in FAERS data)  
2️⃣ **GABA:** Deep relaxation and sleep. (Benzodiazepines = 2nd highest AE/death rates)  
3️⃣ **Dopamine:** Motivation and engagement. (Stimulants/antipsychotics = dependency, motivational collapse, deaths)  
🎁 **Endorphins:** Added later for advanced reward systems.

---

## ⏰ Time-of-Day Logic

- **Morning:** Breath, hydration, tongue cleaning
- **Mid-Day:** Light movement, hydration, mental wellness snack
- **Evening:** Brushing, showering, gentle reflection

---

## 📈 Why It Matters

✅ Supports users in **rebuilding daily care** without shame.  
✅ Uses **micro-wins** to re-engage dopamine pathways safely.  
✅ Aligns with **circadian rhythms for mental wellness.**  
✅ Replaces punitive care structures with **game-based healing.**  
✅ Supports **data tracking and engagement scoring** for therapeutic progression.
