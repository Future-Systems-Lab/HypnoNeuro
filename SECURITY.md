## Smart Contract Risks

This project uses custom-written smart contracts that may carry inherent blockchain risks, including but not limited to:
- Loss of funds due to logic errors
- Unauthorized access due to misconfigured permissions
- Contract upgradeability concerns (if applicable)
- Token transfer logic abuse (e.g., reentrancy, approval exploits)
- Gas inefficiencies or denial-of-service vectors

**Users are strongly encouraged to audit and verify contract behavior** before interacting on mainnet.

## Best Practices

- Use wallets that support hardware signing for mainnet transactions.
- Verify token addresses directly from official GitHub or Etherscan sources.
- Never send tokens or funds to unverified contracts.
