# 🧠 HypnoNeuroToken (HNT)

**An ERC-20 token with mint, burn, and pause functionality — designed for the HypnoNeuro decentralized mental wellness ecosystem.**

---

## 🔍 Overview

HypnoNeuroToken (HNT) is a utility token powering the **HypnoNeuro gamified healing platform**. It supports the decentralized reward system for:

- Player progress in therapeutic rooms  
- NFT-based milestones (Mind Mastery NFTs)  
- Practitioner payments and premium services  
- Discounts and token-based session booking  

Built using OpenZeppelin's secure ERC-20 contract structure, HNT includes:

- 🔐 `Ownable` — restricts minting/burning/pausing to the platform owner  
- 🔄 `ERC20Pausable` — lets the contract pause all transfers when needed  
- 🔨 Minting: Controlled token creation  
- 🔥 Burning: Allows token removal by users  
- ⏸ Pausing: Freezes transfers in emergencies
