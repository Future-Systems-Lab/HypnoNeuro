# 🧠 NFT Metadata

This folder contains the JSON metadata files for HypnoNeuro™’s Mind Mastery NFT badge system.

Each metadata file corresponds to a unique NFT level and contains traits, IPFS image references, and descriptive attributes needed for minting and verification.

## 📂 Structure

- `foundation.json` → Level 1: Hypnosis (White)
- `elevation.json` → Level 2: Mental Wellness (Silver)

These files will follow the [ERC-721 metadata standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721) and will be pinned to IPFS prior to minting.
