# HypnoNeuro™: Where Mental Wellness Meets the Metaverse™

HypnoNeuro™ is a decentralized, gamified mental wellness system rooted in trauma-informed care, privacy-by-design, and natural healing. Built on Ethereum and IPFS, it replaces shame, overmedication, and inaccessibility with avatar anonymity, tokenized access, and reward-based healing.

This platform exists because the current mental health system ignores trauma, punishes vulnerability, and betrays its own ethical foundation: *first, do no harm*.

We are using blockchain technology exactly as it was intended: to build systems that do not require permission. Just as naturopathic medicine honors the body’s innate capacity to heal, blockchain respects individual sovereignty and privacy, ensuring access to care without interference or censorship.

## 🌿 Purpose and Ethos

HypnoNeuro is designed to guide the consciousness through grief, loss, depression, anxiety, insomnia, childhood wounds, and trauma using **gamified naturopathic and orthomolecular methodologies**.

This system is not a distraction tool. It is a **living, adaptive system for transformation**.

---

## 👩🏽‍⚕️ Creator's Background

Dr. Meg Montañez-Davenport is a doctor of naturopathic psychology with a doctoral focus in orthomolecular psychiatry, board certification in holistic nutrition, and advanced training in neuroscience at Duke University and health informatics at Johns Hopkins University.

Her commitment to creating HypnoNeuro is rooted in lived experience, including childhood abuse, homelessness, and the loss of her older brother to suicide, ensuring this system remains practical, compassionate, and trauma-aware.

## 🧪 Orthomolecular Psychiatry and Naturopathic Psychology

- **Orthomolecular Psychiatry** uses targeted amino acids, vitamins, minerals, and nutrients to support biochemical recalibration, addressing underlying contributors to emotional struggles.
- **Naturopathic Psychology** recognizes the inseparability of mind, body, and spirit, applying nature-based approaches, present-moment awareness, and somatic practices to guide the system toward alignment.

These frameworks work with the body’s innate intelligence while respecting the pace of the healing process.

## 🕊️ How HypnoNeuro Works

HypnoNeuro game modules bridge in-game learning with real-world application, guiding users through three core healing rooms:

- **Hypnosis Room:** Cultivates present-moment awareness and subconscious reprogramming for emotional regulation.
- **Orthomolecular Room:** Provides education and actionable steps for nutritional and biochemical support.
- **Inner Child Room:** Supports reconnection with and healing of early emotional wounds.

Each room delivers practical, trackable practices that align daily actions with consistent mental wellness, allowing users to progress meaningfully beyond the screen.

---

## 🌌 Why This Matters

Most mental health systems manage symptoms while ignoring trauma, nutrient depletion, and the deeper emotional wounds driving suffering.

HypnoNeuro offers a new path by integrating gamified, private, and accessible tools that honor the body’s pace and the cyclical nature of true healing.

**Healing does not require perfection, only presence and consistency.**

---

## 🛤️ Future Development

HypnoNeuro is designed for **scalable expansion**.

While current modules address grief, depression, anxiety, insomnia, and childhood wounds, future development will extend support to:

- Schizophrenia
- Bipolar Disorder
- Addiction Recovery

Advanced modules will help users track daily events, foods, and moods to identify patterns linked to changes in mental state, including early signs of **mania and psychosis**. Using the L1–L3 system, users will learn to recognize early signals and take clear, natural steps to support stability.
