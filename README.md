# HypnoNeuro™: Where Mental Wellness Meets the Metaverse™

HypnoNeuro™ is a decentralized, gamified mental wellness system rooted in trauma-informed care, privacy-by-design, and natural healing. Built on Ethereum and IPFS, it replaces shame, overmedication, and inaccessibility with avatar anonymity, tokenized access, and reward-based healing.

This platform exists because the current mental health system ignores trauma, punishes vulnerability, and betrays its own ethical foundation: *first, do no harm*.

---

## 🌿 Purpose and Ethos

HypnoNeuro is designed to guide the consciousness through grief, loss, depression, anxiety, insomnia, childhood wounds, and trauma using **gamified naturopathic and orthomolecular methodologies**.

This system is not a distraction tool. It is a **living, adaptive system for transformation**.

---

## 👩🏽‍⚕️ Creator's Background

Dr. Meg Montañez-Davenport is a naturopathic doctor of psychology with a doctoral focus in orthomolecular psychiatry, board certification in holistic nutrition, and advanced training in neuroscience at Duke University and health informatics at Johns Hopkins University.

Her commitment to creating HypnoNeuro is rooted in lived experience, including childhood abuse, homelessness, and the loss of her older brother to suicide, ensuring this system remains practical, compassionate, and trauma-aware.

## 🧪 Orthomolecular Psychiatry and Naturopathic Psychology

- **Orthomolecular Psychiatry** uses targeted amino acids, vitamins, minerals, and nutrients to support biochemical recalibration, addressing underlying contributors to emotional struggles.
- **Naturopathic Psychology** recognizes the inseparability of mind, body, and spirit, applying nature-based approaches, present-moment awareness, and somatic practices to guide the system toward alignment.

These frameworks work with the body’s innate intelligence while respecting the pace of the healing process.

## 🕊️ Purpose of HypnoNeuro Games

All HypnoNeuro game modules are designed to **bridge in-game learning with real-world application, structured within three core healing rooms**:

- **Hypnosis Room:** Guides present-moment awareness and subconscious reprogramming for emotional regulation and grounding.
- **Orthomolecular Room:** Offers education and actionable steps to apply nutritional and biochemical support for mental wellness.
- **Inner Child Room:** Facilitates practices to reconnect with and heal early emotional wounds, fostering safety and self-compassion.

Each room delivers **practical, trackable, and embodied practices** designed to align daily actions with consistent mental wellness, allowing users to experience meaningful change beyond the screen while progressing through each healing stage.

---

## 🌌 Why This Matters

Many mental health systems focus only on managing symptoms, often ignoring trauma, biochemical imbalances, and the deeper emotional wounds that drive suffering.

HypnoNeuro is designed to facilitate deep, measurable healing through a structured three-room system:

- The **Hypnosis Room** supports present-moment awareness and subconscious reprogramming.
- The **Orthomolecular Room** addresses the biochemical foundations of mental wellness.
- The **Inner Child Room** reconnects users with the emotional root causes of patterns and suffering.

By guiding real-world practices through gamified, private, and accessible technology, HypnoNeuro transforms helplessness into conscious creation while honoring the body's pace and the cyclical nature of true healing.

Healing does not require perfection, only presence and consistency.

## 🛤️ Future Development

HypnoNeuro is designed for **scalable expansion**.

While initial modules address grief, depression, anxiety, insomnia, and childhood wounds, future development will extend this system to support more complex conditions, including:

- Schizophrenia
- Bipolar Disorder
- Personality Disorders

Advanced modules will guide users in **tracking daily events, foods, and moods to uncover patterns that may trigger or precede episodes**. Using the L1–L3 system structure, users will learn to identify early warning signs of recurrence while exploring effective, natural interventions.

For example, the system can help users recognize when certain foods or nutrient imbalances, such as elevated copper, align with mood instability or psychotic episodes, providing insight into potential biochemical contributors while connecting these patterns to emotional and environmental triggers.

By combining **nutrient balancing, lifestyle adjustments, and present-moment awareness practices**, HypnoNeuro empowers users to address both the physical and nonphysical dimensions of mental health challenges, including the impact of unresolved trauma.

This approach ensures HypnoNeuro remains a **gamified, decentralized, stigma-free system for deep, practical mental health support**, helping users actively participate in their healing process with structure, education, and clarity.
