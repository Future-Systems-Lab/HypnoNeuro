# HypnoNeuro™: Where Mental Wellness Meets the Metaverse™

HypnoNeuro™ is a decentralized, gamified mental wellness system rooted in trauma-informed care, privacy-by-design, and natural healing. Built on Ethereum and IPFS, it replaces shame, overmedication, and inaccessibility with avatar anonymity, tokenized access, and reward-based healing.

This platform exists because the current mental health system ignores trauma, punishes vulnerability, and betrays its own ethical foundation: *first, do no harm*.
