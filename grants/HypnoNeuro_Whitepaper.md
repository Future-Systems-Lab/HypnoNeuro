## Notes for Upload

* Use **paragraph breaks** to ensure readability.
* Use **code blocks** for any formulas or technical specifications.
* Use **GitHub markdown tables** for nutrition, tokenomics, and comparative data.
* Use `#`, `##`, `###` headers consistently for hierarchy.
* Replace **emojis** with text for professional tone.
* If desired, use badges or shields for "Version 1.0" at the top for polish.

Once finalized, **copy-paste this cleaned structure into your GitHub `HypnoNeuro_White_Paper_v1_0.md` file** so it renders professionally for stakeholders and investors.

If you would like, I can prepare the **full, correctly formatted markdown file with your actual white paper content** next so you can copy-paste directly without manual reformatting. Let me know if you want that prepared now.
